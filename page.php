        <p>Hello, World! My name is Chris, and I am a web developer currently located in South Florida. I have a background in teaching, yet I simultaneously and continuously hold the position of student. I am always looking to expand my knowledge and to grow as a developer with the aim of creating software that benefits everyone involved in the process!</p>

      <div class="about-text">
        <p>For the past six years, I have been a social studies teacher - as well as de facto tech support - at a small private school in South Florida.</p>
        <p>I enjoy learning as much - if not, more - than I enjoy teaching! My passion for learning can easily lead me to research and obsess over topics ranging from the development of utopian communities throughout mid-nineteenth-century America to the disappearance of shopping malls to the nuances of music subgenres. I appreciate great style, and I am always in pursuit of intellectual conversation!</p>
        <p>My interest in web development began in the mid-1990s when I created a webpage for my favorite video game of all time: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chrono_Trigger" target="_blank">Chrono Trigger</a>. Some twenty years later, after completing Bachelor's and Master's degrees in History, I began taking courses en route to obtaining a third degree in Computer Science. While being steered toward web development, I discovered and completed a Web Development Bootcamp with <a href="http://www.thinkful.com" target="_blank">Thinkful</a>, from which I learned the fundamentals of frontend and server-side development.</p>
        <p>I used my experience in education (both as a teacher and a student) to design several web applications which help to solve issues for students, teachers, coders, job-seekers, and all-of-the-above! (Please feel free to <a href="#projects">check them out!</a>)</p>
        <p>Getting involved in the local coding community has further combined my passion for learning and teaching. Recently, I was invited to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9y3yJtEWYk" target="_blank">give a presentation</a> about the challenges faced by those learning to code in the present year. I was also fortunate enough to offer my skills as a participant in a <a href="https://palmbeachtech.org/2018-palm-beach-tech-hackathon/" target="_blank">Hackathon</a> devoted to creating software which benefits the local county school district.</p>
        <p>Throughout my experience, I have also maintained a blog to serve as a journal of my progress as well as to offer a bit of assistance to newcomers to the field. Feel free to <a href="/blog" target="_blank">check it out</a>!</p>

          <p>Finding a job can be its own job! As coders and job seekers, we know all too well the laborious task of searching job postings, editing resumes and cover letters and trying to remember which company was sent which copy and what interview was scheduled when!</p> 
          <p>Apply Yourself takes care of the drudgery of monitoring job prospects from beginning to end by keeping all aspects collected and organized, with a particular emphasis on the elements related to coding jobs!</p>
